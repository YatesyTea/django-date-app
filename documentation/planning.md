# Django Date App Planning

# Scope and Requirements
For this project I want to create an app for date ideas, and show few options with the option to reroll (similar to my final year project with meals).
For the MVP of the application I just want to have a MongoDB that has a list of ideas that will display 

# Moscow for App

* Have a database upon which these date ideas are stored.

# Feature List

# UI and Navigation Planning

# Database Design (MongoDB)

# API integrations
Google Maps API to find places for the relevant keywords in a given city or location (within x amount of miles)
I do *not* want to use location data from the browser for this, I instead would like the user to input desired location.
